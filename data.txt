Spring Quarter Reflection

Finals week

Wow that was a massive amount of work that I completed. I wish I had started it all a little earlier. It’s tricky though because I was pretty booked all the way up until that week. I’m really impressed with my self for getting all that work done and learning so much in a single week. I feel so happy that I get to learn computer science at Stanford and really play in the big leagues here. These are all the smartest mother fuckers ever and I get to work with them and hang out with them and learn from them. I feel like I showed good character this week by doing my work honestly and trying my best and staying excited and movtiated through it all. Things I could have done better 
1. Work smarter. Spend more time thinking carefully about why I’m doing what I’m doing. For example don’t spend 4 hour debugging something that your team will decide it not going to be used
2. Initiate projects earlier. Open the assignment as early as possible. 

It would’ve been nice to actually have fully finished each of my projects and I totally wish that I could’ve gotten like positive results for the machine learning project and made my Web app a little better and actually finish the Spotify betting app but of course it’s like three projects, and I kind of waited until the last week or two to start and finish those out a way that I could’ve got them all that but I don’t know I would’ve been cool to have started those earlier and like really finish those projects and imagine like if I could put those two on my portfolio and I really want to finish those with my extra time this week that site super solid software engineering portfolio just from 1/4 so that

I did that hard thing that excited me, not the easy thing for the good grade

Work smarter

Finishing Projects

Main reflections 
- I would have been in my own in the world right now and I have almost nothing going on entrepreneurially 
- I need to build my skills this summer and get in with the Actual builder community at Stanford. 
    - How: Apply to YC winter and Summer. 
    - Build projects with people for friends and family demos 
    - Apply to google SWE 
    - Meet with and get to know VCs
    - Stay in touch with builders. Lyron, Longo, Ian Lim, etc
    - Remember to think about important problems while making stupid hacks as well
    - There should be a few clear bug problem (spaces) that I’m really passionate about where if I graduated I’d be like. Ok I’m gonna go do this
    - Have a list of 10ish excellent Stanford people (engineers, etc) that I would pull in to co found with me
    - Another route is join a fire GSB start up 
    - Join all of the builder community groups, and have a portfolio to show for it. 
- By this time next year I want to have either a start up or a job locked in or both 
Obv these reflections so far are very career and action oriented. 
- overall I have some anxieties about really launching my career that I’ve been preparing for in the real world. Like I can’t be working towards it anymore. I need to DO it and be fully equipped with the skills needed to get me into google etc for SWE / PM or start a start up (hard skills, network, ideas, communities)
- This was a good school year. Quite intense I would say. Lots of new feelings. Missing some of the old ones. Time felt a bit distorted considering that so many of my friends graduated and I socially graduated. Learned a lot though. My technical skills have greatly advanced which feel great im excited to be building the skill set I need to really bring my ideas to life
